# Klasifikasi-Diabetes

**Project Overview:**
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the classification of diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective management and treatment. By analyzing patient data, such as medical history, lifestyle factors, and clinical measurements, the system will classify individuals as either diabetic or non-diabetic, aiding in early diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.

**Objectives:**
1. Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset that includes patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors (such as diet and physical activity), and clinical measurements (such as blood glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, etc.). The dataset should include labeled instances of diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data by handling missing values, normalizing clinical measurements, and encoding categorical variables. Feature selection and engineering will be performed to improve the model's predictive accuracy.
3. Model Development: Implement a machine learning model, such as mlp and Random Forest The model will be trained to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC curve. Cross-validation will be used to ensure the model's robustness and ability to generalize to new data.

**Technologies and Tools:**
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Frameworks: Flask for web deployment
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab for model development and testing
Dataset: Publicly available medical datasets, such as the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, or custom-collected clinical data

**Expected Outcomes:**

A machine learning model that accurately classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their health data.
A decision-support tool for healthcare professionals to assist in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for diabetes.
Insights into the most significant factors contributing to diabetes, which could inform preventive healthcare strategies.
